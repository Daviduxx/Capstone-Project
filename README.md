# WE DIVE

Welcome to We Dive, my Capstone Project for the Epicode's FullStack Developer Bootcamp!

Basically, this an advanced note taker: As a scuba diver, I need, after every diving session, to log the dive's data, like deep reached, tank pressure, weather condition and more. Unfortunately, I've never found a web application that achieves this goal, with an intuitive user interface and a good user experience. So I decided to create one!
