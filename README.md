# WE DIVE

Welcome to We Dive, my Capstone Project for the Epicode's FullStack Developer Bootcamp!

Basically, this an advanced note taker: as a scuba diver, I need, after every diving session, to log the dive's data, like deep reached, tank pressure, weather condition and more. Unfortunately, I've never found a web application that achieves this goal, with an intuitive user interface and a good user experience. So I decided to create one by myself!


## Features üöÄ

- Welcome page
- User Authentication (signup and login)
- Add a dive once you're logged in
- Delete a dive once you're logged in
- Chenge your profile settings
- See all your dives

## Run Locally üíª

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Daviduxx/Capstone-Project.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd wedide_fe
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm serve -o
```

Be sure you have the SpringBoot library installed on your PC, and be sure your IDE is going to download all the necessary dependency specified in pom.xml files, otherwise will be not possible to run the Java project.

## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

**Angular:** one tha latest frontend technology in order to manage UI components and frontend features.

**PrimeNG & PrimeFlex:** in order to have an awesome but functional UX. These librearies offer a big amount of interesting components and functionality.

**Java:** my favourite programming language.

**SpringBoot:** I used this tool for the web part of the backend. I love the way SpringBoot simplify the developers' life, with integreted Tomcat and dependencies resolution.

**Hibernate:** Integretad with SpringBoot. I used this tool in order to handle the repository part of my project.

**Spring Security:** in order to protect some endpoints and create authentication and authorization (within JWT).

**PostgreSQL:** I used a relational SQL DB. 

Let me know if you enjoy this project, and suggest me some cool feature!

Thank you üíú
